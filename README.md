# Agar_io

AIU Hackathon group project Agar.io made with java
Group Members : Kamil Yunus Ã–zkaya, Mert Efe Sevim, Ahmet Kurt

You are a circular cell that can eat other cells smaller than you, and you get bigger. Score increases as player eats other cells.
Aim is to get the highest score
This code is still incomplete and need some work to be finished
There is only one player for now, and the world is small
Also the camera should move so that player cell is always at the center
If you see any errors or have an idea to improve the code, please make comments, or change the code
Enjoy!!!
